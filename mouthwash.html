Over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes are hardly a rare commodity. They are readily available and many people stock up these blue bottles for better dental hygiene.
<br><br>
However, many do not realize they can whip up their own effective mouthwash at home.
<br><br>
Making your own mouthwash has several very important benefits over OTC mouthwashes, namely it is chemical-free, alcohol-free, superior quality and inexpensive.

<b>Benefits of Clove</b><br> 
Cloves are the tiny flower buds of a tropical tree called Syzygium aromaticum. Clove oil contains a compound called eugenol that is a terrific antiseptic and dental preservative.
<br> 
Eugenol exhibits potent antibacterial properties against oral bacteria and periodontal gum disease, according to a 2011 study published in the Archives of Oral Biology. It also has terrific antifungal properties, according to a 2005 study published in Fitoterapia.
<br> 
Eugenol is also a anticarcinogenic (inhibits cancer) and a dental analgesic (relieves toothaches).
<br> <br>
<b>Benefits of Cinnamon</b><br> 
Cinnamon possesses effective antibacterial properties, as supported by a 2008 study published in Food Science and Technology Research. Plus, it helps treat oral cavities and dental plaque.
<br> 
Cinnamon also relieves inflammation in the mouth.
<br> <br>
<b>Benefits of Peppermint</b><br> 
Peppermint has myriad antiseptic, antibacterial, antimicrobial and antiviral properties.
<br> 
A 2013 study published in the European Journal of Dentistry substantiates the efficacy of peppermint oil as an effective antiseptic solution against oral bacteria.
<br> 
Peppermint oil also increases salivation in the mouth.
<br> <br>
A dry mouth causes halitosis (bad breath). This oil is especially helpful for people suffering from mouth dryness due to regular use of alcohol-rich OTC mouthwashes.
<br> 
Beyond its oral health benefits, peppermint oil has a pleasant taste, an incredible cooling effect and is instantly refreshing.

Your natural, chemical-free, non-hazardous mouthwash is ready!
<br>
Use it twice every day. This mouthwash should last for 5 to 7 days.
<br><br>
<b>Tips</b>
 <br><br>

Carry a little bit of this mouthwash in a small spray bottle (available at your local drug or discount stores) and use it as a mouth freshener on the go.<br>
Add 2 drops of oregano oil to this mixture to further fight bad breath. Oregano oil is a natural halitosis-combating agent.<br>
Add 2 teaspoons of baking soda to remove acid residue from food that causes bad breath.<br>
Add 2 drops of thyme oil to fight cavities and dental plaque. Thyme oil contains thymol, an antiseptic agent found in OTC mouthwashes.<br>
Add 1 drop of myrrh oil to reduce gum inflammation and toothaches.<br>
Add 2 teaspoons of fresh parsley for increased antibacterial effect.<br>
