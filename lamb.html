Are you looking for a cute craft to celebrate that SPRING IS ALMOST HERE!?  (I have some major spring fever going on…)  This adorable q-tip lamb craft is such a cute way to bring some festive spring energy into your house!  You can use the lamb as a place card holder, set up a few in a spring display on the mantle or just make them as a fun activity with your kids.  No matter what you use it for, it's pretty hard to look at this cute little lamb without smiling!

I can't seem to find the original source behind the idea for this craft, but it sure is adorable and I certainly can't take credit for the idea!  The materials are pretty darn simple.  Most people have q-tips around the house, but if not, just run out to the dollar store and pick up some inexpensive ones.  You can use them for all sorts of crafts!

<b>Materials:</b>

 Q-tips<br>
 White glue<br>
 A fine tip magic marker<br>
 A pink pencil crayon<br>
 Scissors<br>
 White paper (heavier white card stock would be best if you have some.  Use the back of an old greeting card if you don't have any card stock.)<br>
 2 Clothes pins<br>
 Red ribbon<br>

First, you'll need to cut out the lamb's body and the lamb's head.  The body is just an extended oval.  And the head is kind of egg shaped.  Just remember, that the bigger you make these pieces, the more q-tips you'll need to cover them, so don't go too crazy.  I think the body on mine was about 3" long and it felt just a little bit too wide.

Next, cut off the tips of the q-tips.  Be prepared - they are going to go flying across the room!  Try to rig up some kind of blocker so they can't fly too far after you cut them.  I had to send my kids on a mission to pick them all up off the floor.

Start by adding a small line of glue at one end of the lamb's body.  I prefer using white glue because it's easier to work with, but if you don't want to wait overnight for it to dry, you could definitely use your glue gun.

Start with the outer edges and overlap the second layer of q-tips on top of the first layer.  Keep on adding lines of glue, and q-tips as you work your way across the lamb's body:

There's really no magic way of getting it perfect, just do your best to end up with rows of q-tips that overlap and kind of look like the photo below.  You'll want the area that you finish with that has the q-tip ends exposed to be on the right.  You'll be using the head to cover up the ends.  Make sure you let the body dry completely before you add the head.

Next, move on to the head.  Add a small amount of glue to the narrow part of the egg shape and add three q-tip ends.  Make sure you choose q-tips that have been cut to a similar length to keep it looking neat and tidy.

Next, find a scrap piece of skinny ribbon, tie it into a small bow and glue it to the top of the lamb’s head. I cut some ribbon off of a Christmas tag that was in storage.  You'd be surprised where you can find ribbon lying around – Doll clothes, gift tags, girls' hair accessories, greeting cards, outgrown clothes.  I'm sure you can find something around the house rather than buying a whole package of ribbon just for this.

Make sure you wait for everything to dry completely before you glue the head to the body - you might want to leave it over night.  It takes a bit of effort to get all those q-tips lined up perfectly, so it's extremely frustrating when they all shift out of place because they weren't quite dry!  If you don't have enough time to wait, just use a glue gun instead.

Once the lamb is dry, take two clothes pins and glue them to the back of the lamb.  I used white glue, but again, a glue gun would be way faster!

Since the clothespins are wide at the bottom, your lamb should be able to stand up on it's own!  And since the clothespins can clip open and closed, this little guy can double as a place card holder too!  All you do is clip a card into the clothespins, stand him up and you have a festive table accessory!

This is a fun spring time or Easter craft that you can do with your kids... and by "with" your kids, I pretty much mean you'll have to make the whole thing by yourself, unless your kids are older.  Do this as a fun activity on a rainy spring day, or make a bunch to use as place card holders on the Easter table (okay, that might take you a really long time, but think about how cute it would look!).  It's pretty hard not to smile at this cute q-tip lamb craft!
