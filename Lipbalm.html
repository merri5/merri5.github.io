Treat your dry, chapped lips with your own homemade lip balm made with natural ingredients. It is a great alternative to commercial lip balms loaded with synthetic chemicals.

You can make it using <b> beeswax, coconut oil, castor oil and honey</b>. Beeswax is known for its emollient, soothing and softening properties. It forms a protective barrier on your lips to prevent dryness. When melted and combined with other ingredients, it helps make your lip balm harder.

Coconut oil, being rich in fatty acids, helps nourish your lips and keep them moisturized. Plus, its antioxidant properties protect against damage. Honey also helps retain moisture, thanks to its humectant properties, and works as a natural flavoring.

This recipe also includes a little castor oil because it leaves a soft, glossy shine on the lips. To give it a nice fragrance and a refreshing tinge, you can also add a few drops of peppermint essential oil.

Store your homemade lip balm in a cool, dry place. It should last for several months. If your homemade lip balm turns out softer and oilier, you can also use it as a cuticle cream to soften and moisturize your cuticles.
<br><br>

<b>Tips</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
You can vary the amounts of beeswax and coconut oil, depending on whether you are going to store it in a lip balm container (use more coconut oil and less beeswax so it is not too hard) or a lip balm tube (use more beeswax and less coconut oil to make it harder).<br>
When transferring the melted solution into lip balm tubes, use a dropper to avoid spills.<br>
To create a double-boiler for melting the beeswax, fill half a pan with water and turn on the heat. When the water starts boiling, put your bowl containing the beeswax mixture in it. Simmer on low heat until the mixture melts completely.<br>
If using a microwave to melt the beeswax, be careful not to overheat as beeswax is highly flammable. The wax should melt in 30 seconds to 1 minute.<br>
When melting the beeswax, do not cover it as the condensation can ruin the texture of your lip balm.<br>
To add color and flavor to your homemade lip balm, add ½ teaspoon of cocoa powder. You can also use beetroot powder, mica powder, alkanet powder, or lip-safe micas and colorants.<br>
If you do not want to use beeswax, consider using candelilla wax (a vegetable wax) and pair it with shea butter along with coconut or almond oil. When substituting candelilla wax, use half the amount specified for beeswax.<br>
Compared to commercial lip balm, you may have to reapply your homemade lip balm several times a day.<br>
